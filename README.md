# Main Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my central repository for Python development. This collection demonstrates my work in applying Computer Science principles to solve mathematical and statistical problems.

## Featured Projects

### 1. The Omni-Calculator (v1.2)
A robust, terminal-based CLI tool designed for error-free mathematical computation.
* **Core Functions:** Quadratic Equation Solver ($R^2$), Conditional Probability ($P(A|B)$), and Descriptive Statistics (Mean).
* **Key Features:**
    * **Dynamic Error Handling:** Custom `getFloat` logic ensures the program never crashes on invalid input.
    * **Scalable Architecture:** Uses Dictionary-based menu systems for easy expansion.
    * **Input Validation:** logical checks for statistical validity (e.g., $0 < P \le 1$).

## Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Concepts Applied:** Control Flow, Data Structures, Exception Handling, Linear Algebra logic.

## Future Roadmap
* **Kinematics Engine:** Physics simulations for 1D motion.
* **NumPy Integration:** High-performance vector operations for large datasets.
