# 📊 Python Engineering & Data Portfolio
**Talani Malwandla Mlangeni** | *Student at North West University*

Welcome to my central repository for Python development. This collection demonstrates a shift from basic scripting to **Advanced System Architecture**, focusing on modularity, data persistence, and professional error handling.

## 🚀 Featured Project: The Omni-Calculator (v1.8)
A professional-grade, terminal-based CLI tool designed for complex mathematical computation and persistent data logging.



### 🛠️ Professional Features
* **Object-Oriented Architecture (OOP):** Built using a **Model-Manager pattern**. I separated the data structure (`Calculation` class) from the data handler (`OmniCalculator` class) to ensure code reusability and clean encapsulation.
* **Persistent Data Logging:** Implemented a custom CSV logging system that records a full audit trail of calculations, including timestamps, operation types, and raw inputs.
* **Smart Input Processing (Regex):** Utilizes Regular Expressions (`re` module) to sanitize user input, allowing for flexible data entry (commas, spaces, or semicolons) without system crashes.
* **Modular Design:** Optimized for scalability by separating logic into multiple Python modules (`OmniClass.py`, `Calculation.py`), mirroring professional software development workflows.

### 🧮 Computational Engine
* **Quadratic Equation Solver:** Handles real roots and discriminant logic.
* **Probability Suite:** Calculates $P(A|B)$ with rigorous input validation for statistical bounds ($0 \le P \le 1$).
* **Descriptive Statistics:** High-accuracy Mean, Median, and Mode calculations using the Python `statistics` library.

## 💻 Technical Stack & Skills
* **Languages:** Python 3.x
* **Persistence:** CSV Data Management & File I/O
* **Patterns:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Modularization, Model-View-Controller (MVC) logic.
* **Tools:** Regular Expressions (Regex), `datetime`, `os` system interfacing.

## 📈 2026 Roadmap: Data Science Specialization
* **Phase 1 (Current):** Unit Testing with `pytest` to ensure 100% logic reliability.
* **Phase 2:** Transitioning math logic to **NumPy** and **Pandas** for high-performance vector operations.
* **Phase 3:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on real-world datasets using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
